# Search-Engine-Elastic-search-

Building Search Engine by these steps:
-Import DB (cleaned version) into Mongo
-Make Indexing for our imported DB collection in MongoDB
-Make search queries in MongoDB
-Make indexing for the same data in Elastic Search
-Make search queries in ES

**I found that**
Elastic Search is faster than MongoDB
MongoDB Indexing can't search on part of word
Elastic Search can search on part of word since it use n_gram
